# Book Search App

## Overview
Deployed at: https://lgraham-book-search.herokuapp.com/

In this activity, I created a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Using the app

This application required at minimum 2 pages, check out the following mockup images for each page:


Search - User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

Saved - Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
